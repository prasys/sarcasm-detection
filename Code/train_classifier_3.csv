I just don't understand how anyone who's curious and inquisitive would prefer to repeat secular ""common sense"" inside of church instead of trying to go deeper into the Bible's and the Church's fascinanting philosophy.  Why would such person be called an intellectual? 

Also, does an intellectual worships science?  If you go to any humanities college, there's no worship of science going on. 

So I was a little disappointed with the article.  I do feel like a stranger in churches.  But not because people have any prejudice against me.  Every intellectual is a little rebelious.  That's not a Christian quality.",0

999,"So the solution to that is having constant upward pressure by creating money out of nothing that is constantly inflating, since any deflation is catastrophic?  Because that is often the conclusion of the Keynesian/new economics argument that you began. 

People need *wealth* to trade for other *wealth. * But when our central banking system is such that new money can be printed to drive down interest rates (allowing companies to expand and raise wages faster than they would otherwise have been able to) and pay for government programs that fall short in budgeting, the balance is thrown off.  There is new money in the system, but the same amount of wealth.  It works great at first, creating a boom.  But eventually the market catches up with the fact that people are trading more paper money for the same amount of *stuff*, and you have a contraction, or a bust. 

It is often hard to argue against your statement in a populist setting, since what you said is essentially true.  If people have more money, they can spend more money.  But what you have not taken into account is what French economist Frederic Bastiat called ""what is seen and what is unseen. "" I would reccomend reading his essay of the same name and seriously considerin it's implications.  I used to think along the same lines as you until I read it. 

I would also point out that it is small and medium sized businesses that create jobs.  New businesses are therefore the best path to future job creation.  However you seem to be (possibly indirectly) arguing that demand side limitations is what hinders this.  As someone actively trying to start a business right now, I can tell you that demand side has no effect on my business plan, as I only intend to sell my product for $300, which is what I believe the market can handle.  Jumping through all the regulatory hoops is killing me though.  Just one quick example out of many: if I want to set up my business as an LLC in order to secure business loans and give myself a layer of protection, in Massachusetts I have to pay a $500 registration fee.  Then *every single year* after that, I would have to pay an additional $500 fee for the privledge of filing my annual report with the state.  This annual report serves noones bennefit but the states, I might add.  

If you want new jobs to be created quickly, remove all the regulations hindering small business development.  And if you don't believe that it's that bad, I would invite you to to ahead and try starting a business yourself.",0

And, unfortunately, people like this guy are the reason why Morgan Freeman does not believe in God - because people like this guy force you to choose between science and God.   Here is a excerpt from an interview with Morgan Freeman:

----------

Q: Did we invent God? 

A: Yes. 

Q: So there isn't a God up in the sky somewhere.  We came up with God ourselves. 

A: Well, here's a scientific question: Has anybody ever seen hard evidence?  What we get is theories from our earlier prophets.  Now, people who think that God invented us think that the Earth can't be more than 6,000 years old.  So I guess it's a question of belief.  My belief system doesn't support a creator as such, as we can call God, who created us in His/Her/Its image. 

----------

There are millions of people who believe that ""God invented us,"" and also think that the idea of a 6,000 year old Earth is ridiculous.   But those people are drowned out by folks who find that things like evolution uncomfortable and thus reject it, making the faith look foolish by association.   If the loudest proponents of Christianity presented the case for God in a reasonable fashion, and admitted that theism is a matter of *faith*, I think we'd have far fewer atheists than we have by having those proponents insist that we have empirical proof of God, and reject science because it doesn't fit the narrow worldview they've created for Him.",0

Instead, they seek out a crisis that will occur *if they do nothing at all*.  Failure to act is not the same as acting.  This way, they can say, ""its not our fault the government shut down.  We put out a balanced budget, just no one wanted it.

With sufficient more or less relatively progressive Democratic Super Majorities (Not rotten with Blue Dog ilk) in the House and Senate, relatively modest and obvious electoral, campaign finance and media reforms will become feasible, to curtail Republican dirty tricks and prevent them from ever again stealing an election to regain Majorities.

999,"What a steaming pile of horseshit.   I guess democrats have all the answers to all the world's problems and republicans have nothing good to say whatsoever.   We can just dismiss them all.   

This kind of thinking is what's wrong with partisan politics, and as a matter of fact it's what's wrong with most religious thinking as well.   ""We have all the answers and we're not going to talk you because you're wrong. ""  It's so childish.",1
999,"What a condescending, pretentious little brat.  I am neither old nor white, but I think there's plenty of room in the Republican Party for values-voters who are firm in their convictions and believe that an age-old, hallowed vestige that has survived for over a millenia - and is, as Pat Buchanan would have it, the cinderblock of every good civilization - should not be reconstructed or demolished without so much as the batting of an eyelash. 

For every Jon Stewart-worshipping, dope-smoking millenial we mesmerize with our modernistic, reinvented, ""new and improved"" charms, we lose a folksy, tradition-revering, flag-waving Hank Hill or Charlie church-going, evangelical Christian.  Is this shallow-minded, shortsighted, moral degenerate really going to allow the Cultural Marxists, who have already been permitted to hijack every major institution in sight, to frame the debate for us, rather than fight in the trenches for the divinely ordained, sacrosanct moral order that holds society together?  

There's a reason heteronormative marriage has withstood the test of time: dual gender parenting - a mom and a dad - provides a balanced, ""best of both worlds"" approach to the upbringing of our youth.  It sows the seeds and lays the groundwork for ordered liberty, civil government, and moral restraints on the insatiable appetite for avarice and sin.  It is where division of labor, separation of responsibilities, disciplinary action against unruly behavior, unwritten codes of conduct, a rugged work ethic, self-sufficiency, and self-governance originate.  It is a sanctimonious and wholly organic institution.  

Men and women, though it is not some unwavering biological imperative in all cases, are genetically and biologically different - mothers typically being more nurturing, empathetic, and emotionally in-tune, and fathers typically being more stringent - stressing achievement, discipline, and hard work above all else.  Fathers are generally more geared toward what's rational and this-worldly, mothers toward what's spiritual and transcendent.  

Most people who favor traditional marriage do not do so out of a deep-seated animus for those who deviate from the natural order: the Westboro Baptist Church and its devotees are but microbacteria in a petri dish.  They don't even claim the conservative mantle, in any case.  They are not our titular spokesman, nor do they represent us.   Religious and conservative leaders of yore have, for the most part, affirmed for themselves that marriage is between a man and a woman: Ronald Reagan, Pope John Paul II, G. K.  Chesterton, and C. S.  Lewis.  

We needn't wilt or capitulate before the mob: Biblical truths and inviolable institutions are forever - much more important than elections, ambitions of power, prestige, or social acceptance.",0

999,"&gt; Should Reading the Bible Make One an Atheist? 

From the quoted Jillette test:

1:260:51 And I read the Bible cover to cover.  And I think that anyone **who is thinking about maybe being an atheist**, if you read the Bible or the Koran or the Torah, cover to cover, I believe will emerge from that as an atheist. 

Jillette is referring to a mindset (i. e. , people that already have doubts, considering leaving the Religious Faith) whilst the article author writes from the position of someone defending the Religious Faith/not doubting.   These different approaches, or points of view, will very likely result in different conclusions.  If one is reading the Bible from the POV of doubt, the narratives will provide ample evidence to grow that doubt into non-belief or lack of belief.  If the reader has the POV that God is real, that the narrative supports this position and that God is supreme, then that person will take the same narrative and see a positive towards God.  Confirmation bias is action. 

I found the article to be a bit of a strawman. 

However, for those that wish to understand the Bible better, this short phrase is good advice:

&gt; ""**Go to the source material**""

Examine the scriptural material, and it's source, of the narratives that predated the Torah/NT concerning ""God"" (Yahweh), and the worship of God.  From whence did Yahweh, and Yahweh worship originate?  How did this worship change before the Torah authors put oral tales to script?  How did the image of Yahweh, and Yahweh worship, evolve between the periods of the authorship of the sources of the Torah?  of the NT?",0

999,"The argument has some serious anachronisms that prevent it from being as effective as it could be. 

To begin with, the word *protest* [derives](http://www. etymonline. com/index. php? term=protest) from the word *protestari* from Latin which meant ""avowal, pledge, solemn declaration. ""  The first [usage](http://www. etymonline. com/index. php? term=protest&amp;allowed_in_frame=0) as ""statement of disapproval"" is attested in 1751 and is very clearly related to the side-effects of some of the more radical offshoots of the Protestant Reformation.   However, the contemporary sense at the time was very clearly that it was ""a solemn declaration of reformation of the Church around the Gospel's message,"" not as a call to be ""*always criticizing* everything that isn't us"" like this article seems to imply. 

That anachronism is borne out when we examine what the 15th Century Reformers actually did.   The majority of the Protestant Reformers specifically set out a vision of an ""Evangelical Catholic Church"" that corrected the errors they were protesting.   Furthermore, they generally retained the Creeds and Church Fathers and taught there is ""One Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church. ""  The clear intention was only to repair the unity of the Church around the Gospel's promise which felt had been disrupted by the abuses in the Medieval Church.   Therefore, this is why most Protestants are not ""protestants"" like this article describes, as the article itself noted. 

The notion of ""reformational catholicism"" is already inherent in most non-radical Protestant philosophies.   There were, of course, many radicals who sought to continue the reforms in ways that were against the original intent of the Reformers.   These radicals were clearly criticized by these same Reformers, however.",0

It would barely travel faster than cars, cost more to ride, and cost taxpayers hefty amounts to keep running in the future.  Yes, the federal government was willing to chip in large amounts.  But that doesnt mean Iowa wants to pay the upkeep costs forever after that.  We have too much existing infrastructure that needs repairing before we add another new mode. 

In a lot of areas it just doesnt make sense.  Trains can be great for high density areas, such as having light rail options in cities and regional rail in our more dense areas.  But trying to link them in less dense areas, like the midwest, makes little sense, especially when there are existing options (such as things like Megabus) that operate cheaper (for the consumer and government), faster, and without the massive infrastructure investment to push a 3rd mode of travel (in addition to vehicle and air).

The debt was $1. 142 trillion on the date of Reagan's first budget (beginning of Fiscal Year 1982), and it was $2. 857 trillion at the end of his last budget, for a percent increase of 150%.   For GWB, $6. 228 at the start and $13. 562 at the end, for a percent increase of 118%.   As for Obama, $13. 562 at the start and $17. 204 currently, for a percent increase of 27% (but he is only responsible for 4 fiscal years so far).

Bottom line, pointing fingers about the debt is a losing argument for Republicans.   The best thing to do would be to stop talking about it, sweep it under the rug, and make sure it never happens again.   I mean, can you imagine if Obama was on track to increase the debt to $33. 905 trillion?!   That's what it would take to be the equivalent of what happened under Reagan.

The idea of buying up individual properties is just ridiculous.   They can't maintain those properties properly.   Each house has its own set of unique issues, because they were built with the idea an individual would buy and live the house and maintain it themselves.   

The people who cooked up this plan, should have taken those billions of dollars and just bought large apartment complexes.   Oversight would be easier, the buildings are built to withstand the wear and tear being rentals and maintenance can be dealt with more efficiently.   For all we know the reason they didn't go that route is because they knew they could write their own rules with individual properties. 

Remember the part in Upton Sinclair's book ""The Jungle"" where the family rents to own a property, that is in fact just badly built with a ""cess pool"" underneath.   This is what is happening again.

999,"The problem is actually much worse.  Unemployment among young people is at a level that would have been considered a crisis on par with the depression  in 1950. 

Fixes are not as easy as raising the minimum though, we have a much broader work force (almost all women work outside the home which was less the case in 1950) and much less demand for labor do to automation and computers. 

Its not just factory jobs either, we have tons of software solutions that render human labor far less necessary, heck even the humble voice mail is a job killer. 

So while raising the minimum wage and even indexing it is fair its not going to help very much and might even speed up automation since robotics are getting better by the day. 

There is an  ethical solution, social credit (pay everyone a base wage) combined with  a distributive  economic system (changing the system to incentivize distribution within the middle tier) but they are politically difficult to get into play. 

Also both require big changes, a much smaller military, trade controls  and deep limits to immigration which have other issues. 

And note the current solution of social democracy doesn't work well.  Europe has it and also has heavy youth unemployment and low birth rates.  Its not as bad as actual Marxism (100% fail by volume) but it doesn't seem to resolve the problem.  Its slows the bleeding but it doesn't heal the body.

If Obama was as good as Reagan and got a 118% raise he would be making $339,050/yr. 

Comparing spending or debt to GDP is more legitimate.  As a percentage of GDP, Obama is spending more than Reagan.  As a percentage of GDP, debt increased by about 20% under 8 years of Reagan.  Under Obama has already exceeded that.  See graphs below:

[Spending to GDP percentage](http://www. usgovernmentspending. com/spending_chart_1792_2014USp_15s1li011lcn_F0f) Also, notice before FDR and the new deal, federal spending was about 2. 5% GDP except during wars.  Since WW2 is has averaged about 20%.

[From the New Republic:](http://www. newrepublic. com/article/115134/gop-death-watch-final-days-republican-party)

*American party coalitions are heterogeneous, but they endure as along as the different groups find more agreement with each other than with the opposition.  After Republicans won back the Congress in 1994, they developed a political strategy to hold their coalition together.  Many people contributed to the strategy including Newt Gingrich, Karl Rove, Paul Coverdell, Paul Weyrich, and Ralph Reed, but the chief architect was probably Grover Norquist, a political operative who, along with Rove and Reed, came of age in the early Reagan years.  The strategy was based on creating an alliance between business, which had sometimes divided its loyalties between Republicans and Democrats, and the array of social and economic interest groups that had begun backing Republicans. *

*In weekly meeting held on Wednesdays at the office of his Americans for Tax Reform, Norquist put forth the idea that business groups, led by the U. S.  Chamber of Commerce and the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB), but also including the specialized trade associations, should back socially conservative Republican candidates, while right-to-life or gun rights organizations should back tax cuts and deregulation.  What would bind the different parts together was a common opposition to raising taxes, which Norquist framed in a pledge he demanded that Republican candidates make.  Business could provide the money, and the single-issue and evangelical groups the grassroots energy to win elections. *",0

I also don't think poverty is to blame because children poor children from poverty areas do excel.  It is the breakdown of social values and the family support unit.  Children from homes that promote education can and do succeed.  

We have a cultural problem with education.  We expect everyone to be high achievers and work white collar jobs making very high wages.  I like what Mike Rowe promotes, that college isn't for everyone and that you can succeed without a college education.  College isn't for everyone.  People with less than a high school education can build a solid life.   

Please don't misunderstand, social programs are important, but social programs have failed to universally improve the areas the article addresses.  We need a new not a tired old strategy.  Again, social programs are important and needed, but social programs will not solve the problems with education.  

One footnote, I think teachers unions get a bad reputation because they are set up to protect and advantage labor over the education of students, that fact cannot be denied.  Their first mission is to promote the welfare of the teacher.   When they protect bad teacher's, they get (but don't deserve) the reputation they get.  I cringe when I see a teachers union spokesperson talk about how high quality education is their number one goal, when everyone knows the number one goal is to enhance the welfare of the union members.  People can spin the goals of teachers unions with talking points all day.  They need to be genuine.  Even the children know the unions are disingenuous at times.",0

This is why many of us railed against him from the beginning - he was, and remains, completely out of his league from a basic knowledge and experience perspective.   He is not bright enough, not experienced enough, not intelligent enough and certainly not humble enough to understand and **respect** what he and his cohorts do not know.   The administration as a whole acts like the classic first-year grad students who have this sudden epiphany about the utter simplicity of a solution to a long-standing problem that many others have attempted, and failed, to fix.

I think that we need to tip our hats to the concept that buses are not the same experience as a car or a train - they are usually the equivalent of steerage because they are limited in size and thus can't offer amenities like snacks or the ability to stretch your legs.  

We need to try and understand the costs in a more equal manner - is the cost of building, maintaining, and patrolling our highways built in to any cost comparison when rail is deemed ""more expensive""?  Or are the costs just less visible to cars, because you're only thinking about the cost of gas to fill your tank?  

Using federal reimbursement rates, the cost for a 90-mile car trip would be $50 one-way - that is the estimated cost of gas plus depreciation.  Now assume that tolls are a fair approximation of the cost of maintenance of the highway - tolls can be $5-20 per car for the same trip (including things like bridges).  

I just priced a 90-mile route and was quoted $21 by Amtrak.  That means for up to about 3 people, rail is more cost-effective on its face - however that does neglect the cost to get to/from the stations.  It is at least competitive for a party of 2. 

The main problem is that the duration of the trip is over 3 hours.  But does it have to be?  Why can't the train go 100 MPH?  That would cut travel down to a competitive level.",0

999,"I am a youth minister.  To some comments in this thread, I'd like to respond.  Youth ministry may have been absurd in Jesus' day, you're right, it didn't exist.  (And it doesn't exist now- see the Andrew Root article linked below) Neither did adolescence, and neither did the deep nuanced culture our youth find themselves facing every day.  Now, it isn't our job to prop up or indulge adolescence, quite the opposite.  (Andrew Root goes into detail on that huge point [here](http://www. faithformationlearningexchange. net/uploads/5/2/4/6/5246709/ym-doesnt-exist. pdf)) Yes, youth ministry as a segregated congregation of youths that can be fully understood by itself, is not the church.  Yes, a youth ministry that is a baby-sitting service, or making church a carnival so the kids won't leave, or making it a funeral so they won't mess up the church with their hijinks, is bad.  Yes, like any other part of the church bastardizing the gospel for the ease of those inside or for our own ideas of success, youth can be bad.  But there is a theology of youth ministry, thanks to folks like Kenda Creasy Dean (www. kendadean. com) and  Andrew Root (www. andrewroot. org) that teaches us how to minister rightly to those adolescents in our congregations.  

Absolutely I think youth ministry MUST be intergenerational.  As pastor, I am facilitator of relationships and member of relationships.  Youth ministry is not the [one-eared Mickey Mouse model](http://www. abpnews. com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/one-eared-mickey. jpg), but firmly placed and integrated with the larger church.  At my church, our youth group acts as small group.  We have our own worship on Wednesday, where they learn to lead and create and engage, to find their voice and get content, and contextualize, but we also do everything the greater church does.  Taking youth ministry away and assuming that this assimilation will magically happen otherwise because there's no other option is sad for church kids, and disastrous for unchurched kids.  

Youth ministry IS ""letting the children come to Jesus"" I am a pastor at my church who focuses on youth, not a pastor solely for youth.  With someone there to invest in them and relate to them, they have the full access an adult has to someone to disciple them and help them in their journey with God.  Someone who has been to seminary, has made this their life's work, not just someone doing it to ""help out. "" Not that that's the end-all, but it's what our adults get, isn't it?  

My teenagers are equipped, they are within the larger church, they are called to be fully Christian, just like adults.  I'm not raising Diet Disciples.  They are given adult mentors from the congregation.  And they are living into that.  

Also, quick word on things like ""Divided. "" Divided comes with a lot of theological baggage and is almost predicated on the idea that the youth minister is a usurper of the father's sovereign power over his family as the male leader.  There are many more informed voices speaking on this subject who will raise better objections and questions, and leave us with better answers.  

I agree youth ministry must not become a golden calf, but it absolutely exists because of the way culture has designed itself.  It is human person to human person relationship in Christ.  It is not to be just one more problematic segregation in the church, but just because we give it a name doesn't mean it has to something other than just ""ministry. """,0

They are willing to let the economy crash and for Americans (of course, minus the *wealthy* Americans) suffer until they get their demands met. 

I hope that history and Americans are wise enough to judge these people as what they are: traitors.  In every sense of the word.  They have turned their backs on their country's best interests, their constituents, the history of America and are abusing their positions to kowtow to the needs of the wealthy exclusively.

Here's a good rule of thumb for what should be privatized and what shouldn't.    If you want to control the OUTCOME of a given situation, then socialization is the way to go.    The whole raison d'etre for private enterprise is to make money, NOT provide whatever outcome you desire.      

Lets use the example of a sewage system.  

The outcome you want is basic sanitation for obvious reasons. 
Now, you can give that job to government, where the entire enterprise is set up to provide the service without having to make a profit.   If you give that job to private business, their entire purpose is to make money.    Making money takes precedence over providing the service.    One of the primary ways to make money for the private enterprise is to NOT provide the service. 

So when the OUTCOME matters, it's best to pool our resources as a society and bring down the price of the outcome we desire. 

Stossel and other conservatives ignore/reject this simple concept in the vague hopes that someone will be able to take more money from the American taxpayer than the government would in taxes to provide the service in the mistaken belief that privitazation generates more economic growth.    Which even if true, does not negate that 

If privatization works so great, where are the all too obvious examples?    Halliburton isn't exactly a poster child for spending taxpayer dollars efficiently, is it?

The only reason there are ""ethical clouds"" is because of journalists who re-state these unwarranted allegations to the casual news reader.

$6000 insurance

$1000 deductible

$1000 in co-pays, 20% of bills for cancer tests, two rounds of x-rays, ultrasound, etc... 

$8000 paid so far.   Guess what?   I have a kidney stone. 

Good news, there's a procedure available that smashes the stone, but you have to be anesthetized, needs more tests before we can put you out, bloodwork, EKG... 

Another couple hundred dollars. 

And the procedure?   I will owe 20%, which is $3000. 

I don't have another $3000, so I can't really afford to have it done.   Am I risking future kidney function?   Possibly, yes. 

Total bill for kidney stone: 

$5000

$6000 for insurance



$11,000 Total, if I want treatment.   If not, suffer.   I can't currently afford it, so.... 

Awesome, huh?

I've been saying this for years and it never seems to sink in.   To fairly compare taxes in the U. S.  with other countries you have to add in the costs of healthcare and college.

Imagine the subconscious emotional pressure your brain is under, when your significant other is trying to convert.

""  But, besides that, here is the unique person on Earth you are bonded to, and *they* are pushing this dogma on you.   A weak ego is going to cave like an eggshell. 

Plus, *she wasn't an atheist. *  She never considered the proposition ""God: Yes or No? "" in any clarified manner.   She took her religion from her ""super-smart"" father and let it lie as it was...  until her boyfriend hatched his conversion plans on her. 

Plus, she has never been exposed, apparently, to secular speakers, or psychologists, who deal with human issues from a non-religious viewpoint:

&gt; ""But then the pastor preached.  I was fascinated.  I had never heard a pastor talk about the things he did. ""

Meditation can be a wonderful thing.  But then a priest comes in, slaps a ""prayer"" label on it and makes it icky. 

She apparently went through this brainwashing process for 8 months, all the while being coached by her boyfriend, and after all that, **she ...  has a dream**.   That's all the rigorous proof anyone needs, right:

&gt;""My boyfriend would pray with me for God to reveal himself to me.  After about eight months of going to hear Keller, I concluded that the weight of evidence was on the side of Christianity.

Maybe its because there isn't as much of a connection because of the social aspects associated with drinking.

Its unraveling would catastrophically undermine their underlying ideology of ever-expansive central government providing cradle-to-grave care for an ever-grateful citizenry. 

&gt;For four years, this debate has been theoretical.  Now it’s real.  And for Democrats, it’s a disaster. 

&gt;This is the signature legislative achievement of the Obama presidency, the embodiment of his new entitlement-state liberalism.  If Obamacare goes down, there will be little left of its underlying ideology. 

&gt;Perhaps it won’t go down.  Perhaps the Web portal hums beautifully on Nov.  30.  Perhaps they’ll find a way to restore the canceled policies without wrecking the financial underpinning of the exchanges. 

&gt;Perhaps.  The more likely scenario, however, is that Obamacare does fail.  It either fails politically, renounced by a wide consensus that includes a growing number of Democrats, or it succumbs to the financial complications (the insurance “death spiral”) of the very amendments desperately tacked on to save it.

999,"Its not surprising that this article takes an anti-investor stance, and is chock full of misleading information.   It's a slow day at work today, so I thought I'd write a few bullet points as I was reading through it:

1.  Blackstone isn't ""owned"" by any of those banks listed.   The fancy sounding SEC filing is just a list of who owns Blackstone's common stock (ticker: BX).   The list includes all of the mutual funds those companies manage, which means if you as a normal person buy for example the JPMorgan Large Cap Value Mutual Fund, you own a portion of those BX shares, which gets aggregated in that list.   Not so evil... 

2.  The reason that real estate agent is seeing less minority buyers is because the lending standards have gotten tighter, and safer.   There are no more zero money down purchases.   If you blame the crash on the banks giving these easy money loans, then you can't also blame them for now *not* giving these loans. 

3.   The ""besuited businessmen"" paying cash are not swooping in and taking homes from hard working immigrants who are about to close.   These companies like Blackstone are buying houses out of foreclosure directly from banks, or at large auctions.   Not so evil. 

4.   After buying the houses, they are hiring property management companies, contractors, and repair men to get the houses back into rentable condition as quickly as possible (within 90 days).   That's literally thousands of blue collar people being put to work in areas that need it most. 

5.   Blackstone isn't ""speculating on housing prices"", looking to quickly flip them, or creating another housing bubble.   The key reason this is not true is because they are not building new construction properties.   These are all houses that already exist, and they are simply fixing them back up, and allowing people to move back into them in an affordable way. 

6.   Most of the people that were foreclosed upon are not able to get a new mortgage right now.   They don't have 20% savings to put down, they are probably living check to check.   But their family and kids are used to living in a house, in a neighborhood.   They don't want to move into a 1 bedroom apartment building.   Now Blackstone comes in, and offers the opportunity to stay in a house, with the same schools, etc.   This isn't predatory.   People are paying rent, but now they have the option to do so while living in a house. 

7.   Now that all these houses are owned by Blackstone, they are in no hurry to ""flip"" them for profit, because they are making a profit monthly by simply holding onto them and renting them.   The new boilers, new roof, and general maintenance is all factored into the profitability.   Most leases are 2 years, so there isn't constant turnover, and people are more likely to care for the houses with a decent respect.   

8.   Eventually, the ownership of these houses will likely be split off into a separate company, and stock will be sold to people that want to own real estate without doing the work (See the recent IPO of SilverBay:SBY).   The company will continue to own and operate the homes, pay income to shareholders, and the stock value will increase in value when the homes do.   The exact same thing has happened for years and years in commercial real estate and multi-family apartment real estate investing.   Not so evil.

999,"I am so sick and tired of the whole ""media cabal"" bullshit excuse.   The notion that the solution to the supposed problem is to fire 90% of editors and hire ones you ""can't control"" is just plainly stupid.   

There are surely sources of news that are better than others.   If you rely on 24-hour cable news channels like CNN, MSNBC and Fox News as your sole sources of news, then yes - you deserve constant ridicule.   If you get your news from fucking blogspam sites where recycled news is mashed up and force fed back to you, you deserve being ignored.   If you get all your political news from one political perspective, you could not care less about opposing views and it is pointless to engage you in a fact-oriented discussion.   Those people are the problem.   They're the ones that resort to making claims of ""mainstream media bias"" which they use as a security blanket to avoid actual discussion.  But what about us readers who rely on SEVERAL sources to make our conclusion!?   On Syria for example, I read the Washington Post, Guardian, Reuters, AP, al Jazeera, CNN. com and several other sources.   I heard about the Administrations' claims of intelligence implicating the Syrian regime, of Putin's claims that it was the rebels, I followed the U. N. 's report findings through the Washington Post.   I followed the story as Obama brought it to Congress, the pros/cons, the opinion polls, arguments for and against a strike, the videos of children dying from the Sarin.   I am more informed these days than ever before, so this disgruntled guys claims ring hollow.   He just comes across as some pissed off guy.   A cynic without a compelling argument. 

The point is, I am grateful for all these news sources and am not convinced by indignant people like Hersh that they're all ""in the pockets of Obama. ""  Let me ask you this Mr.  Hersh:  what publication is your shining example of journalism?   You sure as hell didn't say.   Who sets the standard on reporting excellence? 

Well, the Guardian lends you credibility by noting **your Pulitzer Prize. **  You're one of the good guys.   So who else is winning this prestigious prize in the area of International Reporting (that he later derides in the article)?   

From the past decade:

* 2013 - NY Times

* 2012 - NY Times

* 2011 - NY Times

* 2010 - Washington Post

* 2009 - NY Times

* 2008 - Washington Post

* 2007 - Wall Street Journal

* 2006 - New York Times

* 2005 - LA Times and Newsday

* 2004 - Washington Post

* 2003 - Washington Post

* 1970 - Dispatch News Service (Seymour M.  Hersh)

So my two most preferred publications (NYT &amp; WP) dominate the Pulitzer prize for international reporting.   Fire 90% of these editors!?   It's trite nothingness.   Any fool can cast stones at an entire profession, but how about he put his money where his mouth is and call out some articles, some editors, some authors?   He indicates a systemic problem but can't even get close to substantiating it! 

Seriously, those who agree with Mr.  Hersh - what news source is your beacon of truth?   What organizations and people are the standard bearers that the rest of the ""pathetic"" media should aspire to be?   I really want to know, because this type of bullshit generalization is a cheap and empty tactic.",0

&gt; Second, everyone struggles with hypocrisy, you find it everywhere.  It's just more obvious and glaring in the case of people who despise the ones their religion tells them to love and to help. 

Christianity I think makes this especially hard.   The ""ask"" it makes of people is impossibly big - not only should you not sleep with someone else's spouse, you shouldn't even look at them and feel lust; not only should you follow all the rules, but you should also give all you have to the poor; not only should you care for your family, but you should also embrace all those you despise.   So basically, nobody - with the exception of Jesus - lived an actual ""good"" life.  Everyone is a sinner.   You can't possibly live up to the standard set by Christian ethics. 

At the same time, Christianity gives you what is oft interpreted as a ""get out of jail free"" card.   Act like a dick on your commute?  Ask God for forgiveness, Jesus has paid the price!

$10 dollars an hour isn't that much.  The federal minimum wage in 1968 was $10. 68 (inflation adjusted), and that does not include productivity gains.  With that included, it would be above $20/hr.  While I am not one to support a rise to such a level ($20/hr may be too extreme), I believe a rise to around $1203/hr indexed to inflation would be good.

Governance should be a sacrificial act of public service.

I do have trouble reading the Old Testament a bunch like watching a movie where people are doing stupid things,""Do the right thing! "" is what is in your head.

I dunno.  I think there are plenty parts of the Bible that are construed as *arguments*.  

Hell, there's a sense in which *any claim that's made about the world* is an argument.  And there's some evidence that ancient texts (in the Hebrew Bible and elsewhere) were written to advance a particular theological view (or even to argue that [insert phenomenon] was in fact not a natural event, but a divinely-sanctioned one). 

I mean, nowhere is this sort of ""argumentation"" any clearer than in the epistles of Paul.  While in some places he assumes an audience familiar with certain aspects of Judaism, we know that his churches were significantly Gentilic.  He would have to totally convince them of the reality of a deity that they did not previously embrace/believe in (""Ever since the creation of the world his eternal power and divine nature, invisible though they are, have been understood and seen through the things he has made"").  In Acts, the author has Paul challenging Epicurean and Stoic philosophers, and trying to *convince* Athenians to embrace the gospel. 

Further, the gospels themselves are structured and have many motifs that were meant to appeal to Gentiles (to the extent of downplaying Jesus' Judaism).",0

I dont remember why I didnt do it to be honest.  I just kept thinking, well, even though my family will be sad, when they get to heaven, we'll be back together.

But then, the real left does not call for electoral boycott, here and now, in the US, going into the 21st Century. 

Nobody's perfect in every regard. 

Without going into the substance of purported ""left"" critique of Brand, I have my own analysis as to why is he is very substantially incorrect, despite being somewhat correct, more or less, in his critique of capitalism, and of it's main claim to fame, ""democracy"", such as we now know it. 

While correct in many regards, he is simply, politically, incorrect, to advocate electoral boycott, in my analysis. 

Those who do so, from a purported ""left"" position tend to believe it's better for the extreme right to prevail electorally, based on a ""theory"" that the draconian conditions guaranteed to ensue from that will ultimately goad the masses into rising up to overthrow capitalism altogether... while voting in bourgeois reformists, they say, will only serve to ""lull the masses to sleep"", thinking ""it's all good now"", thus preserving capitalism. 

This rationale gave us Hitler, Nixon, Reagan and Bush(s)... and 2010. 

It has failed to produce revolution, anywhere, but it has indeed ushered in moar draconian rightwing anti-democratic counter-revolutionary policies, ruining the lives of millions of people all over the world, and suppressing revolutionary popular democratic struggle for generations. 

I also take issue with the premise that ""mere"" bourgeois reforms lull us to sleep, or fool us into thinking capitalism is all better now, heh. 

Reforms only get our nose open for moar.   Give us an inch, and we'll take a mile. 

What better arena to press the contradictions of capitalism, and bourgeois ""democracy""?   

A mass electoral uprising, to purge and suppress the right, from now on, would be a good thing, seems to me.   

Which, of course, is why the right is freaking out, over our first Black Muslim ""Socialist"" Democrat ""fascist"" Prez, heh, who seeks to impose the popular democratic will against the ""freedom"" of racist, sexist, eco-raping rightwing reactionary conservative fundamentalist monopoly corporate fascist murderous ripoff pigs... who are now the ones calling for civil war, lol. 

The right recognizes that should a more viable democracy emerge, it will ultimately mean the death of capitalism as we now know it, and of it's moribund form, fascism.

999,"&gt; Charles and David Koch are both members of the . 00001%.  That’s a group of twenty individuals who **have a total net worth of over a half-trillion dollars, about $26 billion each**. 

I didn't trust a numerical analysis from someone who things that $52 billion = over half a trillion dollars, so I checked the numbers. 

Using the figures from the the excel spreadsheet they link to, they gained $12 billion in wealth together ($6 billion each). 

That's almost $32. 9 million a day, $1. 37 million an hour, $22. 8 thousand an hour, or $381 a second. 

The article says that the food stamps are for $1. 50 a meal, so per year that's $1. 50*3*365, or $1642. 5.  Therefore, it would take them 4. 3 seconds to feed her for the year if they were to split her food stamps bill. 

This is absolutely shocking by itself.  Getting the numbers so wrong totally discredits the criticism, though, and that's a real pity. 

(Note that I'm not checking the base figures that the article provides, but I'm not convinced they're accurate given how careless the author is with the calculations.  Also, if I've made a stupid mistake here, I'd love to know!  If so, I'll confess idiocy and apologise unreservedly! )

999,"The Holy Bible has never condoned homosexual marriage.  It clearly states it in several scriptures.  If homosexuality was something that was okay with God, wouldn't there have been some essential archetype on which we would be able to base pro-homosexuality beliefs?  God made a man and a woman.  Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve.  Would not God have given us an example where homosexuality was okay?  The only love between people of the same sex can righteously be seen through Philadelphians love.  Brotherly/sisterly love between two people of the same sex is okay, much like Jonathan and King David.  I hope this has cleared up some things for Christians who are unsure of which belief to side with.  Below is scripture from the Bible to support my beliefs.  

Leviticus 18:22 - Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it [is] abomination.  

Leviticus 20:13 - If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood [shall be] upon them.  

Romans 1:24-27 - Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves: 

Matthew 19:4-6 - And he answered and said unto them, Have ye not read, that he which made [them] at the beginning made them male and female, 

Now of course, I believe homosexuality is a sin people struggle with, but I am writing this to clarify that yes, I love gay people just as much as thieves, liars, adulterers, etc.  The Bible demands that we as Christians are still to love them the same, and for anyone who believes that we are not, you obviously do not read the Bible, where it says to love everybody.

That rumor aside, as much as I like Warren, I still think she's too inexperienced.  Clinton would have arguably more well rounded and applicable experience than any presidential nominee to ever run for President: First Lady, Senator, AND Secretary of State.  Her track record at each of those positions is pretty stellar.  PLUS, looking at the electoral map, she has the best chance of any nominee that I can think of Democratic or Republican due to the fact she could realistically carry Arkansas AND against Governor Christie, I read somewhere she is polling 4 points AHEAD in New Jersey.  Show me a realistic electoral map where a Republican nominee can win without Arkansas. 

Warren will have her time, but I think she should use these 4 years in the Senate and whatever other public office she can hold during hopefully Clinton's 8 years in office before considering a run of her own.  By that time she'll have the experience and political wherewithal to actually be effective and win.

It's unsustainable when our younger people are leaving the state to expect those few who do stay to support those who need healthcare the most.    Without a younger workforce attracted by a diverse and strong in-state business climate to warrant their residence, who will to shoulder the tax burden for those who use healthcare the most?   I'm curious to learn if the law and program will be challenged under the equal protection clause since the benefit of single payer protection may not extend to those who pay into the system but are not offered single payer benefits due to being offered health insurance through their employer.   The Governor and the Vermont Assembly need to take a long hard look at our state's constitution before assuming powers not expressed.

* Proverbs 15:6 In the house of the righteous [is] much treasure: but in the revenues of the wicked is trouble. 

**Wealth is a sign of wickedness. **

* Matthew 19:23-24 Then said Jesus unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you, That a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven.  And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.

He sounds like he's running a business more than a ministry. 

** Via /r/politics **

* He donates the books to the church and allows them to sell them for profit.  This essentially creates a nice little tax write-off for him.  It also blurs the lines between ""profit from the book"" and money from the church.  Essentially, he is treating your church as a nice little tax-haven. 

* His salary is set by 4 other Mega-Church Pastors.  They also pay an undisclosed amount of money to each other for visiting each other's churches.  It's a ""you scratch my back I'll scratch yours"" situation.  They also refuse to reveal said salaries.  Essentially, this is a very creative and business-like approach for him and the other Mega-Church pastors to make millions while denying any responsibility in said salary.  It is no different than 5 CEOs setting pay for each other. 

* They bring in over $20 million annually.  Barely over $2 million goes to the community.  A lot of it goes to production and improvements, however, unlike nearly every other Southern Baptist church, the pastor's pay remains a secret.  From my understanding these Mega-Churches are an exemption from all other Southern Baptist bylaws, however, there is absolutely no reason to keep these salaries a secret unless there is a fear of public ridicule or shame.  All employees are also required to sign a nondisclosure form and are threatened with a lawsuit if they reveal church financials.",0

While race cannot be the predominant factor in creating electoral districts (2), gerrymandering has been defended under the argument that it provides minorities with greater sociological representation.  This is an argument often made by both sides (3).

Everyone always assumes that the civil rights only worth fighting for include:

* women

* LGBT

* illegal immigrants

* blacks

But neglect things like:

* gun ownership

* right to privacy

* freedom of religion (across the board, from catholics to muslims to norse, and everything in between)

The senate as a whole absolutely holds more power than the president and therefore senators who can influence the entire body (or at least a majority) hold a unique power in the government.  

Not to mention that her strengths are specifically as a consumer advocate who is tough on Wall Street and banks.  Does that  translate to being a great president?  Not necessarily.  Does it translate to being a great senator?  Absolutely, because you are allowed to focus on a narrower range of interests.  

And lastly, while she has great appeal to liberals and progressives, she doesn't exactly have that same appeal all over the country.  Middle of the road voters, the type you need to win presidential elections, still fear the picture that the right is able to pair of people like her.  To be clear: they don't fear her unfiltered policy ideas, they fear the politician that the right would portray her as.

2 is an attempt to repackage Pascal's Wager.  I'm certain Pascal came before CS Lewis. 

3 is more meaningless words.  The kind that can mean anything depending on the reader and therefore really hold no meaning (something that can mean anything is ultimately meaningless). 

4 echoes words that have been said for probably as long as we've had words to say, certainly best summed up by Shakespeare - T'is better to have loved and lost...  There is nothing ""ahead of it's time"" about that. 

5 amounts to ""actions speak louder than words"".  Any form of this statement is not new or ahead of it's time. 

6 is wishful thinking.  Also not a new concept which should be patently obvious in this sub given the majority here hold to a belief started some 2000ish years ago that the things in your future will be better than the past behind you.  I don't think CS Lewis pre-dates Christianity. 

7 is a repackaging of the concept of suffering for God.  Once again, I don't think CS Lewis pre-dates Christianity. 

8 is a statement that would hold true no matter when it was said.  In that way it was of it's time when he first said it, not ahead of it's time. 

9 is probably the only example of a thought from CS Lewis (in this list) that is ahead of it's time.  Though I genuinely doubt it is a thought that wasn't expressed or taught or followed by some congregations somewhere in the world throughout the history of the church. 

10 basically says ""heaven is good"".  That's not a thought ahead of it's time.  Once again, CS Lewis does not pre-date Christianity.

999,"&gt; ""Minimum wage isn't supposed to be livable. ""

you know, i'd be fine arguing this one, IF we weren't in the current economic situation we're in. 

minimum wage jobs were supposed to be for kids working their first jobs, part time, to get some entry-level work experience under their belt.   everyone's got to start someplace, right?   or they're for moms of school-age kids who need extra spending money and a flexible schedule of 9am - 3pm.   or they're for retirees who have investment income but want to get out of the house and just need something with low responsibility but high social interaction.   once you got a few years (and a few 25¢ raises) under your belt, you went on to better pay and better skill jobs, either during or after college. 

the problem now is that those better skill jobs haven't opened back up since 2008/2009.   so the only jobs that are available are the ones that are $9 an hour or less...  technically above minimum wage, but not liveable, and certainly not ones that demand the skills college grads and mid-20's (or older) already possess.   so if the only jobs that companies are willing to hire for are the low-skill minimum wage positions, without much hope of raises or even promotions (since a lot of companies have severed the wage increase from the title promotion), then those jobs damn well better pay enough that a single person can support themselves without having to rely on anyone else. 

if you work a second job in order to save up money to better your situation, great.   if you get a roommate in order to save up money to better your situation, great.   if you do either (or both) of those things because nobody is willing to pay enough to let you pay the rent AND eat?   no so great.",0

Years earlier, this patient had a blood gas test that would have confirmed the diagnosis, but the test results were hidden in a hard-to-find section of the medical record.  Without Watson, Mehta says he never would have seen the result. 
&gt; 
&gt; ""The system looks for competing theories that might explain the patient's symptoms""
&gt; 
&gt; The process for finding that crucial test turns out to be remarkably similar to finding the right answer to a Jeopardy question.  Having built a basic concept map from studying medical exams, Watson parses the medical records for facts and test results, then knits them together into competing theories that might explain the patient's symptoms.  Mike Barborak, a natural language engineer at IBM Research, describes it as a step towards a more intelligent kind of machine.  ""It's **language processing** but it's also using this notion of combining those different salient factors to see if one supports or contradicts the other and coming up with some conclusion of what's actually being stated,"" Barborak says.  That means looking beyond the words of the diagnosis for a basic sense of how the words fit together, and what each possible diagnosis means.

It provides easy-to-use interfaces to over 50 corpora and lexical resources such as WordNet, along with a suite of text processing libraries for classification, tokenization, stemming, tagging, parsing, and semantic reasoning. 

It's open source software, and the book to learn it is free.

She could have been raped by a Roman soldier or some other pervert as were thousands of young women.  Back then, the women were penalized more than the rapists.  She could have just told a big lie and started Christianity.  She would have had to tell Jesus that he was the son of God to keep the lie going, so he grew up really believing God was his father.  Jesus was not lying when he said he was the son of God, because he just believed what his mother told him.  This inspired him and connected him to the collective unconscious, what he called the Holy Spirit.  This gave him the ability to channel all the truth that he did.  He looked for the truth in the present, because he believed God, his father, would try to communicate with him.  Just thinking this opened up the door to the universal mind and the truth and the life.  Jesus was very open-minded and brave.

&gt;Government outsourcing to private contractors has exploded in the past few decades.  Taxpayers funnel hundreds of billions of dollars a year into the chosen companies' pockets, about $80bn of which goes to tech companies.  We've reached a stage of knee-jerk outsourcing of everything from intelligence and military work to burger flipping in federal building cafeterias, and it's damaging in multiple levels. 

&gt;For one thing, farming work out often rips off taxpayers.  While the stereotype is that government workers are incompetent, time-wasters drooling over their Texas Instruments keyboards as they amass outsized pensions, studies show that keeping government services in house saves money.  **In fact, contractor billing rates average an astonishing 83% more than what it would cost to do the work in-house.  Hiring workers directly also keeps jobs here in the US, while contractors, especially in the IT space, can ship taxpayer-funded work overseas. **

&gt; Witch Killings:

&gt;Enoch Adeboye is an evangelical pastor from Nigeria who promotes the existence of witches and wizards, resulting in the torture and death of young children and others in Nigeria, the wider African continent, and has also spread into Europe.  (See Ref#1)

&gt;On Christmas Day, 2010, 15-year-old Kristy Bamu was found by paramedics in the bathroom of an East London high-rise flat.  His body had been mutilated, teeth were missing, and he was covered in deep cuts and bruising. 
He had been starved and deprived of water and sleep, punched and kicked repeatedly, floor tiles smashed over his head, his teeth knocked out with a hammer, and a pair of pliers had been used to twist his ear. 
In the last four days of his life, he had suffered acts of unspeakable savagery, viciously inflicted upon him by a man he called ""uncle"" and one of his own sisters.  

&gt;Why? 

&gt;Because Eric Bikubi and Magalie Bamu, the boy’s family members, were convinced that he was a “witch”.   Debbie Ariyo, executive director of Africans Unite Against Child Abuse ...  explains that a boom in Pentecostal churches was leading to more children being accused of witchcraft. 

&gt;An average of eight children a year in Greater London are victims of abuse based on witchcraft-style exorcisms, but this only reflects cases resulting in police investigations.  
According to UK Church Statistics, 670 Pentecostal churches opened between 2005 and 2010, taking the total to 3,900 - that figure is expected to rise to 4,600 by 2015.  As a result, Ariyo fears that ""witch-branding"" will increase.  

&gt;""It is spreading like bushfire because it is a source of income,"" says Ariyo. 
""If you can charge £500 for an oil that is going to 'cure' a child of evil spirits, you are going to make money. ""

&gt;Whilst Adeboye's primary aim may be to exert power over his congregation and to extort money from relatives for cures, many people take the matter into their own hands. 
His preaching will increase the likelihood of people in a segment of the Australian community being accused of witchcraft by radical evangelicals.  Subsequently, this will increase the chance of acts of torture and murder being committed like the case in the UK, referred to above. 

&gt;If torture and murder are the result of this sort of evangelical preaching in a developed Western nation like England, then there is every reason to expect heinous acts to be committed here if the Australian government grants access to this man known for hate-mongering, acts of evil and causing great harm to others.   (See Ref#2,3,4,5,6 and 12)

&gt;Anti- Homosexuals:

&gt;Adeboye is currently campaigning, from the pulpit, for a proposed Nigerian law making Same Sex Marriage an offence punishable by up to 14 years in prison. 
Additionally, he is increasing the danger to anyone seen as being ‘pro-gay’, potentially causing journalists to be too afraid to report the truth. 
In effect (if not intentionally) Adeboyes campaigning will essentially lead to the outlawing of organizations that provide services for gay people, including HIV/AIDS clinics. 

&gt;The Nigerian anti-gay law has already been passed by both Houses of Parliament.  In addition to criminalising Same Sex Marriage, it also punishes public displays of same sex affection by up to ten years jail.   The bill is only awaiting the President's signature to become law. 

&gt;The U. S.  ambassador to Nigeria has said that Enoch Adeboye is not in line with international human rights laws.  

&gt;There are serious concerns in the Australian community that some of Adeboye’s ignorant, vulnerable congregation will interpret what he is saying (""Same-sex marriage is an anathema to the will of God"") to mean that it is ‘god's will’ for them to rid the world of homosexuals.

999,"I prefer it!  I'm a Texan and a while back I had a HORRIBLE kidney stone but I didn't know what it was because I had never had one before, I went to the ER in EXCRUCIATING pain and they treated me wonderfully! 

I got three, count 'em baby three, shots of morphine through an IV, that is an experience I have never had before but enjoyed and would recommend!  Then I left with a handful of prescriptions after a CT scan (is that right?  Some kind of scan! ) and went home and was high as a kite for a few days and then it passed and we were all good again.  Woo! 

So then the bill comes and it's $8000!  So at first I was all like ""woah, shit"" so I called and complained because while in the ER I had specifically ask, repeatedly, how much the scan would cost and had repeatedly had my question refused to be answered by the doctors, nurses, radiologists (or whatever they're called) and even the lady who came in to get my personal info and ask me for a credit card to pay ""as much as I could afford right now"" (I authorized 50$ because she wouldn't explain to me what exactly it was I was paying for ""right now"" and I finally decided they just wanted a card on file). 

Sooo when the bill comes the scan ALONE was 6000 bucks, just the scan, the entire rest of my treatment was only 2000 which I would probably have paid gladly after the wonderful care I got (and I knew I was uninsured going into this and I knew ERs are expensive and at the time I was in HORRIBLE pain and scared shitless by it so I didn't care).  I made my choices and would live with them but 6 grand for JUST THE SCAN?  That seemed unreasonable to me and I also found out later that scans like that aren't necessary for kidney stones and often aren't done unless you're peeing blood, so wtf? 

So this is where the fun starts, I called to complain about this scan cost, I was quite clear that I would pay a reasonable about for my care and was happy with my care but I couldn't afford 8000 total and that 6k for the scan was nuts, so they ask me to fill out some paperwork to see if I qualified for ""financial relief"" from my bill.  I explained again that I didn't want charity, I just wanted a reasonable bill (and BTW, 2000 for the three shots of morhpine and the 10 minutes the doctor spent with me seems a little out of whack too, 800 of that is called an ""ER fee"" and is apparently a charge you get just for walking into the ER regardless of what happens next, but hey they took good care of me and I don't know what the fuck morphine costs). 

Anyway the only option I had was to file for the charitable relief, well ya see I am currently a ""stay at home uncle"" my brother abandoned his two kids with our mom, she can't afford day care (you would not fucking believe how expensive day care is) and since I made less money than she does, I become the stay at home parent.  We all live together now, she pays the bills and I take care of the kids.  It was weird at first but it's actually kinda rewarding and fun now (most of the time).  So technically I'm single with no income and have been for about a year and a half now and my tax returns reflect that.  Actually do have some income for contract IT work with people who knew me before I quit, it's all under the table though. 

Soooo I got FULL relief.  I actually have some money and my mother actually makes ""ok"" money and we were willing to pay a reasonable amount for the bill (my hope was to reduce it by half to 4k and pay it out over time, lower is better of course but I had braced myself to accept 4 grand if I could negotiate hard enough to get there).  Instead I paid 0$.  And I learned a valuable lesson, if it looks like you have no money you can go to the ER for freeeeee!  Wee! 

So suck it tax payers I ripped you off for 8000 bucks and I have three pain pills left over for a rainy day!

Because if you remove the laws holding back entrepreneurs from starting a business, they will 'fill the hole' with a service/product at competitive prices, because others will be offering same/similar product/services.  This competition is what drive prices down.  *Customers voting with their money. *

It's a perfect example of the argument of Centralized planning&amp;control vs.  free market.

If 3D printing is the silver bullet for an industrial process, I expect the first ones to embrace it being professional operators, where any edge over competitors means millions, and I expect some delay (if ever) for the process being accessible for general purpose low cost equipment.
